    "1. It is an object like a dictionary, but with some differences. Elements are stored as dictionary *keys* and their counts are stored as dictionary *values*.\n",
    "2. Counts can be both zero and negative\n",
    "3. Counter objects are created from *iterables* or *mappings*: `{'dogs': 3, 'cats': 2}`, etc.\n",
    "4. Counter objects have a **dictionary interface** except that they return a zero count for missing items instead of raising a *KeyError*\n",
    "5. Setting a count to zero does not remove an element from a counter. Use *del* to remove it entirely from the counter.\n",
    "6. It uses almost all functions used with dictionary objects\n",
